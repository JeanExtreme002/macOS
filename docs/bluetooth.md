# Bluetooth

{mod}`macos.bluetooth` turns Bluetooth on and off, lists the paired devices
with their battery levels, and connects and disconnects them.

```python
import macos

macos.bluetooth.power()   # True

for device in macos.bluetooth.devices():
    print(device.name, device.connected, device.battery)

# AirPods Pro True {'left': 90, 'right': 85, 'case': 40}
# Magic Mouse False {}
```

## Devices

{func}`~macos.bluetooth.devices` returns the devices paired with the Mac,
connected ones first. Each {class}`~macos.bluetooth.Device` has:

- `name`: as shown in the Bluetooth menu.
- `address`: its hardware address, such as `'E4:61:F4:CC:49:B2'`.
- `connected`: whether it's connected now.
- `kind`: what it is, such as `'headphones'`, `'mouse'` or `'keyboard'`.
- `battery`: the levels in percent when the device reports them, such as
  `{'main': 80}`, or `left`, `right` and `case` for AirPods. Empty otherwise.

A low-battery warning in a few lines:

```python
for device in macos.bluetooth.devices():
    if device.connected and any(level < 20 for level in device.battery.values()):
        macos.notify("{} is running out of battery".format(device.name))
```

## Connecting

{func}`~macos.bluetooth.connect` and {func}`~macos.bluetooth.disconnect` take
a {class}`~macos.bluetooth.Device`, its address, its full name, or part of its
name when only one device matches:

```python
macos.bluetooth.connect("AirPods")
macos.audio.set_output("AirPods")      # and play through them
macos.bluetooth.disconnect("AirPods")  # still paired
```

Both wait until the device is connected (or disconnected) and return it, so
the next line can count on it. The device must be on and in range; after
`timeout` seconds (10 by default) they raise {class}`~macos.MacOSError`, as
they do when Bluetooth is off. Pairing a new device
isn't possible here; do it once in System Settings › Bluetooth.

## Power

```python
macos.bluetooth.set_power(False)
macos.bluetooth.set_power(True)
```

It waits until Bluetooth is really on or off, and raises
{class}`~macos.MacOSError` after `timeout` seconds (10 by default). Careful on
a desktop Mac: turning it off disconnects a wireless keyboard and mouse. On a
Mac without Bluetooth, {func}`~macos.bluetooth.power` and
{func}`~macos.bluetooth.set_power` raise {class}`~macos.NotSupportedError`.

Switching the power uses a private macOS framework, since there's no public one.
